# Fashion Mockup

Mockup of this template: https://preview.colorlib.com/theme/ashion/

Live version [here on repl](https://fashion.ewatkins.repl.co/) is a static HTML/CSS mockup only. This version on GitHub is made with React/Express for a little more functionality - including images and a click-to-filter New Products section.

To install: clone this repo, run `yarn` to install dependencies, then `yarn dev` to run server & client.
